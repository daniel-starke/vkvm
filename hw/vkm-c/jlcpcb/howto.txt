Important: Be sure to place the auxilary point in pcbnew (KiCad) at the bottom left corner of the board (including any gerber output dimensions, not only board edge) before generation all files for JLCPCB to ensure positive coordinates

Fix wrong rotation in position output for:
TSSOP-20_4.4x6.5mm_P0.65mm -> +90deg
SOT-23 -> +180deg
USB_C_HRO_TYPE_C_31_M_12 -> y+5.1mm
